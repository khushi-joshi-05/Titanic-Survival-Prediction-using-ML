# Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning models. It was developed and executed in Google Colab using the [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and more. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset used is from the Titanic Kaggle competition and includes:

- `Pclass` (Passenger class)
- `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`
- `SibSp`, `Parch` (Family aboard)
- `Fare`, `Embarked` (Port of embarkation)

The target variable is `Survived`, where 0 indicates the passenger did not survive, and 1 indicates they did.

## Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for model training.
2. **Modeling**: Several machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest are used to predict survival.
3. **Evaluation**: Models are evaluated based on accuracy and other metrics.

## How to Run

To run this project:

1. Open the [Google Colab Notebook](link-to-your-colab-notebook).
2. Ensure you have access to the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train models, and view predictions.

## Models Used

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

## Results

After training and testing the models, the best-performing model will be highlighted in the notebook.
